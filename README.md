# Gas-Volume-Calculator

## Introduction
This application is designed to calculate the volume of a gas under various conditions, including:

* User-defined settings
* Normal conditions (pressure = 0 bar.g, temperature = 20°C)
* Standard conditions (pressure = 0 bar.g, temperature = 0°C)

It incorporates the ideal gas law with a compressibility factor for more accurate calculations.

## Features
* User-friendly interface for easy input of gas properties.
* Calculation of gas volume at:
    * User-defined conditions.
    * Normal conditions.
    * Standard conditions.
* Clear presentation of calculated results with appropriate units.
